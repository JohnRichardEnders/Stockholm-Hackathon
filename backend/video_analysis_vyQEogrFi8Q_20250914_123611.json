The U.S. government is based on a system of checks and balances, and no single individual, including the President or former President, has control over the judicial system. The ACLU article confirms that the Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump is not above the law, which implies that he does not have unilateral authority over legal matters or the judicial process in the country. The separation of powers ensures that legal and judicial functions are outside the control of the executive branch where Trump would have served as President.",

While the primary focus seems to be on Rosie O'Donnell, the evidence includes references to Donald Trump's comments about her, suggesting a broader context where Rosie O'Donnell is contrasted with other women he may have addressed similarly. In particular, the phrase 'Only Rosie O'Donnell' was used by Trump to specify a narrow reference point in an otherwise broader discussion. Hence, while she might be the primary figure of interest, the claim that she is the 'only person' being referred to does not align perfectly with the broader context, indicating it is disputed.",
