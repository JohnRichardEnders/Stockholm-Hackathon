In contrast, studies suggest that welfare programs can effectively reduce poverty levels.\n\nAdditional perspectives introduce the concept of 'welfare traps,' where individuals might lack incentives to transition from benefits to work due to the immediacy of benefits reduction upon entering low-wage employment. These varying points highlight the complexity of the welfare debate, indicating that while fewer people living on benefits could be a desirable goal for some, the factors influencing welfare dependency are multifaceted and heavily debated.\n\nThus, without a clear metric of 'should' or 'must,' and due to the lack of consensus on how best to achieve possible reductions in benefit reliance without increasing poverty, the claim is classified as inconclusive.",

Positive periods may be characterized by investment and trade growth, while negative impacts are felt more acutely by individuals, affecting their subjective well-being. Moreover, long-run economic performance tends to improve due to a decrease in the frequency of economic downturns rather than increased growth rates. This complex interplay supports the claim that an economy can simultaneously exhibit both good and bad characteristics over an extended period.",
